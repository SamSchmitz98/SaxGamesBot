Toblin, Heft and Chung knocked out some guards, so we snuck out, I grabbed a journal from under the bed. We then snuck out the front, killed one or two guys then headed down the sewers with a knocked out guard. We gave some salt to Kobolds and then interogated the guard (Vanof). Said the queen got some cool negation powers. Her sword is magic and can protect her as well as make people bleed out with a touch. Then Orabjorn had a vision from his jewelry and said the Queen is a reaper spy who went rouge so we need to resurrect Lawn and have him help us kill the Queens insane army. The Queen gave an amulet artifact to Gazon to help him take over Bastion. We snuck into the palace to try and kill Gazon, but then Aran tripped and so we had to combat. Ourabjorn got tired midcombat so he took a nap. And then he didn't. Then we killed Gazon and thought combat was over but we forgot about Guard D. So Toblin walked over and smited him with his war hammer Ourabjorn is just about to take the amulet off of Gazon. What's going to happen? Find out next time on Saxes & Sorcery Z!
